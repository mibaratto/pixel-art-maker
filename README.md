# pixel-art-maker

This is the final project of Intro to Programming Nanodegree at Udacity. It's a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.


In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

Defining variables with const and let
Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
Writing nested loops and using loop variables
