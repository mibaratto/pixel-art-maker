# Pixel Art Maker
This is the final project of Intro to Programming Nanodegree at Udacity. It's a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

# Requiriments
The users should be able to:

 - Dynamically set the size of the grid.
 - Choose a color.
 - Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.


### Front-end programming skills developed in this project:

- Defining variables with const and let
- Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
- Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
- Writing nested loops and using loop variables
